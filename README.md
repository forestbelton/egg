ðŸ¥š egg [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/forestbelton/egg.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/forestbelton/egg)
===

egg is a stack-based programming language for code golf, not unlike cjam and pyth.

Properties
----------

* Programs are represented as a sequence of tokens and are evaluated left-to-right.
* Literals are pushed directly to the stack.
* Primitive types include integers (bigints) `-123`, floating-point values `3.141`, strings `"hello"`, and character literals `'a`.
* Operators pop the number of arguments they need from the top of the stack and can push output values.
* Whitespace is optional except to disambiguate token delineation.
* Implicit coercion between compatible types.

For a web interpreter and documentation/examples, visit the language [homepage](https://forestbelton.github.io/egg/).

How to build
------------

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) and [Bower](https://bower.io/). In the project directory, run:

```
$ yarn
$ bower install
$ npm start
```

You may then open `www/index.html` to see the egg UI.
